Stealing everything from Valheim to make a caveman survival world. Will probably manage to get 5% there. If you want to 
keep track of additions or play around/modify stuff:

install git and bash for Windows. 

in bash console:
'pwd' = show current directory (Print Working Directory)
'cd ./somefolder' = change directory from current to somefolder in that directory
'cd ..' = up one level (ex. go back from /C/Users/someusername/desktop/somefolder to /C/Users/someusername/desktop )
'mkdir somefoldername' = create a folder called "somefoldername" in current directory
'git clone https://github.com/fn88/game3' = downloads a copy of that project

Using Visual Studio Code editor and Blender 2.93.8 version.
